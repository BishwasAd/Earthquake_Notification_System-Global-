# Earthquake_Notification_System-Global-
A simple Python-based system that monitors live earthquake data feeds (USGS) and sends real-time SMS alerts for new earthquake events. The project uses Flask for the server, threading for continuous data polling, and integrates with an SMS service Twilio to notify users of significant seismic activity.
